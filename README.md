# [Vue JS Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZXt1Aom3Cs)

I'm trying to learn Vue JS for some contract work, so I decided to go through Traversy's course on YouTube. I find him to be one of the best and most thorough trainers.

At the beginning, there was an interesting project to get familiar with how easy it is to use Vue. I really liked when Traversy showed the _normal_ way to do something and then the Vue way. For instance, the shortened syntax for `v-bind:` being `:`.
